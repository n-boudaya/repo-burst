  abstract = "A large software system contains millions of lines of source
              code, and the development often involves many developers over a
              long period. How to understand and analyze its complex code
              dependencies is challenging but meaningful to developers for
              program comprehension. In this paper, we propose a novel visual
              analytics system to explore code dependencies between files for
              visually understanding software architecture and interactively
              analyzing bad dependencies. The dependencies between files are
              abstracted as a directed graph (i.e., the dependency graph) at
              different levels via the file hierarchy to show the
              modularization design of source code. Node embeddings of the
              dependency graph are learned to identify the files with specific
              dependencies and analyze the similarity between bad dependencies.
              Finally, we evaluate the usability of our system by two case
              studies in different JavaScript libraries as well as a user study
              on software architecture understanding and bad dependency
              analysis.",

    abstract = { Data analysis often involves the comparison of complex objects. With the ever increasing amounts and complexity of data, the demand for systems to help with these comparisons is also growing. Increasingly, information visualization tools support such comparisons explicitly, beyond simply allowing a viewer to examine each object individually. In this paper, we argue that the design of information visualizations of complex objects can, and should, be studied in general, that is independently of what those objects are. As a first step in developing this general understanding of comparison, we propose a general taxonomy of visual designs for comparison that groups designs into three basic categories, which can be combined. To clarify the taxonomy and validate its completeness, we provide a survey of work in information visualization related to comparison. Although we find a great diversity of systems and approaches, we see that all designs are assembled from the building blocks of juxtaposition, superposition and explicit encodings. This initial exploration shows the power of our model, and suggests future challenges in developing a general understanding of comparative visualization and facilitating the development of more comparative visualization tools. }
